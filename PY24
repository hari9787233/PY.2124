1.Assign different grades to students based on their scores.
If a student scores above 90, assign grade A
If a student scores above 75, assign grade B
If a student scores above 65, assign grade C
Solution:

def assign_grade(score):
    if score > 90:
        return 'A'
    elif score > 75:
        return 'B'
    elif score > 65:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'No grade'

students_scores = {
    "Alice": 95,
    "Bob": 82,
    "Charlie": 70,
    "Daisy": 60
}

students_grades = {}

for student, score in students_scores.items():
    students_grades[student] = assign_grade(score)
for student, grade in students_grades.items():
print(f"{student}: Grade {grade}")

 
2.Write a code in Python to do slice [2:5] for following string.
“THISISWORLDBESTPRATICE”

Solution:
text = "THISISWORLDBESTPRATICE"
sliced_text = text[2:5]
print(sliced_text)


3.Perform following file operation.
Read file content 
Write into the file
Solution:
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print("Original Content:\n", content)
with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
file.write("This is the new content written to the file.")


4.Develop a code in python for following scenario
A single class should be mentioned in the code
There should be two data members in the class. 
Solution:

class Student:
       name = ""     
    age = 0        
   
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def display(self):
        print(f"Name: {self.name}")
        print(f"Age: {self.age}")

student1 = Student("John", 20)

student1.display()



5.	Draw a line in a diagram from position (1, 3) to position (8, 10):

Solution:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

start_point = (1, 3)
end_point = (8, 10)


x_values = [start_point[0], end_point[0]]
y_values = [start_point[1], end_point[1]]

plt.plot(x_values, y_values, marker='o', color='b', label="Line from (1, 3) to (8, 10)")
plt.ylabel('Y-axis')
plt.title('Line Plot from (1, 3) to (8, 10)')
plt.grid(True)

plt.legend()
plt.show()


  6  Develop a code in python suing for loop to print 5th table.
Solution:

for i in range(1, 11):  
    result = 5 * i
print(f"5 x {i} = {result}")


7.Write a code in Python to do slice [4:12] for following string.
“THISISWORLDBESTPRATICE”

Solution:
text = "THISISWORLDBESTPRATICE"
sliced_text = text[-2:-12]
print(sliced_text)


8.Perform following file operation.Read file content. Write into the file

Solution:

with open("example.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write("\nThis is appended content.")

with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
file.write("This is new content written to the file.")


9.Develop a code in python for following scenario
A single class should be mentioned in the code
There should be two data members in the class. 

Solution:

def assign_grade(score):
    if score > 90:
        return 'A'
    elif score > 75:
        return 'B'
    elif score > 65:
        return 'C'
    else:
        return 'No grade'

students_scores = {
  "Alice": 95,
    "Bob": 82,
    "Charlie": 70,
    "Daisy": 60
}

students_grades = {}

for student, score in students_scores.items():
    students_grades[student] = assign_grade(score)

for student, grade in students_grades.items():
    print(f"{student}: Grade {grade}")


11.Develop a code in python suing for loop to print 9th  table.

Solution:

for i in range(1, 11):  # Loop from 1 to 10
    result = 9 * i
    print(f"9 x {i} = {result}")


12.Write a code in Python to do slice [-2:-12] for following string.
“THISISWORLDBESTPRATICE”

Solution=

text = "THISISWORLDBESTPRATICE"
sliced_text = text[-2:-12]
print(sliced_text)
14.Develop a code in python for following scenario
A single class should be mentioned in the code
There should be two data members in the class. 
Solution:with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print("Original Content:\n", content)

with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
file.write("This is new content added to the file
